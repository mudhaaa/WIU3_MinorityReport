C:Good God, no matter what you do, you always seem to screw up! It's almost as if being stupid is the only thing you’re good at!

C:Getting drunk and spouting words like that... I hate it so much!
C:Hmmm… now that I think about it, how could we afford this much beer? Factoring in the bills and groceries, 2 bottles of beer is going way over budget! 
C:No way they’re… They’re stealing from me?!! Using MY savings to spend on some beer?! Now how am I going to prove that?
C:Ah! Receipts! If I can show that our income isn’t enough to pay the bills on top of buying beer, that should suffice!
There’s gotta be some receipts somewhere. It’s probably in a drawer. It’s probably locked too. Now where did I leave my set of the keys? 
C:I guess I could use a paperclip too. I could even use them for other locks. There should be some in the storage room. Oh yeah, can’t forget to do my chores as well…
C:Gosh, so many thoughts running through my mind. I gotta take a moment to relax a bit.  Hopefully, that won’t get me beaten.
